==========================

## About

The source includes basic classes for question answering, and interpretation. It also includes a basic HTTP server to use as API access to the question answering.

## Install

The automatton knowledge server requires python, numpy, and BeautifulSoup4. After downloading the source, just open and run the server.py file, and you'll be set to go.
